  abstract = {KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is an integrated database resource for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. Molecular functions of genes and proteins are associated with ortholog groups and stored in the KEGG Orthology (KO) database. The KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules are developed as networks of KO nodes, representing high-level functions of the cell and the organism. Currently, more than 4000 complete genomes are annotated with KOs in the KEGG GENES database, which can be used as a reference data set for KO assignment and subsequent reconstruction of KEGG pathways and other molecular networks. As an annotation resource, the following improvements have been made. First, each KO record is re-examined and associated with protein sequence data used in experiments of functional characterization. Second, the GENES database now includes viruses, plasmids, and the addendum category for functionally characterized proteins that are not represented in complete genomes. Third, new automatic annotation servers, BlastKOALA and GhostKOALA, are made available utilizing the non-redundant pangenome data set generated from the GENES database. As a resource for translational bioinformatics, various data sets are created for antimicrobial resistance and drug interaction networks.}

  abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Many organisms possess a true circadian clock and coordinate their activities into daily cycles. Among the simplest organisms harboring such a 24 h-clock are cyanobacteria. Interactions among three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, and cyclic KaiC phosphorylation govern the daily rhythm from gene expression to metabolism. Thus, the control of the <italic>kaiBC</italic> gene cluster expression is important for regulating the cyanobacterial clockwork. A picture has emerged in which different KaiC phospho-states activate and inhibit <italic>kaiBC</italic> expression. However, the mechanism remains to be solved. Here, we investigated the impact of each KaiC phospho-state on <italic>kaiBC</italic> expression by introducing a model that combines the circadian transcription/translation rhythm with the KaiABC-protein oscillator. We tested 32 combinations of positive and negative transcriptional regulation. It turns out that the <italic>kaiBC</italic> expression and KaiC phosphorylation dynamics in wild type and <italic>kai</italic> mutants can only be described by one mechanism: threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate <italic>kaiBC</italic> expression and the unphosphorylated state suppresses it. Further, we propose that the activator-to-repressor abundance ratio very likely determines the <italic>kaiBC</italic> expression dynamics in the simulated <italic>kai</italic> mutants. Our suggested clock model can be extended by further kinetic mechanisms to gain deeper insights into the various underlying processes of circadian gene regulation.</p>},

  number = {1},
  pages = {69--80},
  abstract = {In the cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, most promoters are regulated by a circadian clock under continuous light (LL) conditions. Nevertheless, the basic circadian oscillation is primarily generated by alternating KaiC phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions at the posttranslational level. Indeed, the KaiC phosphorylation cycle was recently reconstituted in vitro by incubating KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins with ATP. However, the molecular dynamics of this chemical oscillation and the mechanism that drives the circadian transcription/translation rhythms remain unknown. In this report, the KaiC phosphorylation cycle and the gene regulatory network in the cyanobacterial circadian system have been modeled. The model reproduces the robust KaiC phosphorylation cycle in the absence of de novo gene expression as is observed in vitro, as well as its coupling to transcriptional/translational feedback in LL conditions in vivo. Moreover, the model is consistent with most previous experiments, including various combinations of genetic knockout or overexpression of kai genes. It also predicts that multiple KaiC phosphorylation states and dynamic Kai protein interactions may be required for the cyanobacterial circadian system.}

  abstract = {<p>Current standard methods for kinetic and genomic modeling cannot provide deep insight into metabolic regulation. Here, we developed and evaluated a multi-scale kinetic modeling approach applicable to any prokaryote. Specifically, we highlight the primary metabolism of the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942. The model bridges metabolic data sets from cells grown at different CO<sub>2</sub> conditions by integrating transcriptomic data and isozymes. Identification of the regulatory roles of isozymes allowed the calculation and explanation of the absolute metabolic concentration of 3-phosphoglycerate. To demonstrate that this method can characterize any isozyme, we determined the function of two glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases: one co-regulates high concentrations of the 3-phosphoglycerate, the other shifts the bifurcation point in hexose regulation, and both improve biomass production. Moreover, the regulatory roles of multiple phosphoglycolate phosphatases were defined for varying (non-steady) CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, suggesting their protective role against toxic photorespiratory intermediates.</p>},
